# [Project 1:  MPG Data Analysis](https://github.com/jleealejandro/ga_projects.git)
 For this project both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression were used to predict MPG.  The Random Forest model produced slightly better results
  with an R2 score of 75.95 percent.

# [Project 2:  Health Economics](https://github.com/jleealejandro/ga_projects.git)
This project explores the relationship between the average health spend of countries to their mortality rates.  The project was comprised of three data sets, average health
spend per country, average male mortality rates and average female mortality rates.  
The analysis of the data revealed that greater health spend did not translate into lower mortality rates for all countries.  Although in some cases this relationship was
substantiated, there were a number of countries in which this did not hold true. This indicates that there are other intrinsic factors to consider.
